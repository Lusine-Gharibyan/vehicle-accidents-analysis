# Vehicle Accident Analysis

This document outlines the business questions explored in this project.
The analysis is structured across three analytical levels:
- Accident-Level Analysis
- Vehicle-Level Analysis
- Combined Analysis

---

## 1. Vehicle-Level Analysis

- Which vehicle types are most frequently involved in accidents?
- What is the average vehicle age involved in accidents by vehicle type?
- Are work-related journeys more commonly involved in accidents than private journeys?
- What propulsion types (petrol, diesel, diesel-electric, etc.) are most common in accidents?
- Which points of impact are most frequent for different vehicle types?

---

## 2. Accident-Level Analysis

- How do traffic accidents trend over time (by month)?
- What proportion of accidents are Slight, Serious, and Fatal?
- Do accidents occur more frequently in Urban or Rural areas?
- How does speed limit relate to accident severity?
- What road conditions are most commonly associated with accidents?
- Does weather condition impact accident severity?
- Are accidents more frequent during daylight or darkness?

---

## 3. Combined Analysis

- How does accident severity vary by vehicle type?
- Which vehicle age groups contribute most to each severity level?
- Do certain vehicle types have higher involvement in urban vs rural accidents?
- How does point of impact influence accident severity?
