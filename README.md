# vehicle-accidents-analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships among accidents, vehicles, and locations. The analysis provides an overall understanding of the data, highlighting factors such as accident frequency, distribution by time and location, and vehicle involvement.


## Dataset

The project uses the following datasets:
- accident_info.csv – Contains detailed records of accidents, including date, area, weather & light conditions, and severity.
- vehicle_info.csv – Contains information about vehicles involved in accidents, including vehicle type, age, propulsion.


## Analytical Approach

The analysis follows a structured workflow:
- Database Creation – Setting up a database to store and manage the data.
- Tables Creation – Creating tables: vehicle_info and accident_info.
- Data Loading – Importing datasets from CSV files into the respective tables.
- Data Quality Check – Validating data accuracy, completeness, and consistency, including checks for missing values, duplicates, and correct data types.
- Vehicle-Level Analysis: Exploring vehicle types, age, propulsion, journey purpose, and point of impact.
- Accident-Level Analysis: Studying trends, severity, location, road/weather conditions, and light conditions.
- Combined-Level Analysis: Integrating accident and vehicle data to identify high-risk patterns, e.g., severity by vehicle type, age contribution, urban/rural distribution, and point-of-impact influence.
